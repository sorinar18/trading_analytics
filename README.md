    "traderId": "T001",
    "price": 2000.0,

## üí° Assumptions / Notes
- Trades are unique by combination of traderId and timestamp. Submitting a duplicate trade will result in a 400 Bad Request.

- All data is stored in-memory only. Data will be lost when the application restarts.

- Error responses are standardized:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": {
    "price": "Price must be positive",
    "quantity": "Quantity must be positive"
  }
}

```
- Success responses return plain strings (no wrapping).

```bash

./mvnw test
```
Includes:
- Unit tests for service logic

## ‚úçÔ∏è Additional Notes

- The API is kept simple & clean, focusing on functionality and readability.
